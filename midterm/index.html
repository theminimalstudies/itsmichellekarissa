        SHINee (샤이니, pronounced "shine-ee") is a South Korean boy band formed
        by SM Entertainment in 2008.<br/> The group is composed of 
Onew, Jonghyun, Key, Minho and Taemin.<br/>
SHINee made their debut on May 25, 2008 on SBS' music show, <br/>Inkigayo: The Music Trend, with their single "Replay", 
from their first mini album Replay.
           K-pop’s princes<br/> reigned supreme across the guts of a decade – a tenure largely unheard of in an industry with sky-high expectations,<br/> and what were once beefy contracts that led to break-ups and burnout.<br/>
        When the group first debuted in 2008, the K-pop landscape was very different – more niche, but gaining international audiences<br/> and making leaps in production, largely in tandem and impacted by SHINee’s own rapid growth.<br/> Onew, Minho, Jonghyun, Key, and Taemin set the scene to come with their debut, <br/>RB inflected “Replay”, kickstarting a legacy of critically-acclaimed albums, brand deals, reality shows, and two films about the group. <br/>In 2018, South Korea’s compulsory military service put Onew, Key, and Minho out of action, and the group’s mammoth activity was put on ice.</p></center>
